    <p>When autumn arrives and pumpkin spice cravings hit, there's one dessert that takes cozy season to new heights: Pumpkin Magic Cake. This warm, sweet, and rich treat is a twist on the classic Impossible Cake, featuring a tender spice cake base and a creamy cheesecake layer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Baking spray</li>
        <li>1 (13.25 ounce) package spice cake mix (such as Betty Crocker)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, divided</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2/3 cup canned pumpkin (from 1 [15 ounce] can)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 (3.4 ounce) package pumpkin spice instant pudding</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 10-inch springform pan with baking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine cake mix, water, oil, and 3 eggs in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speet until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared springform pan.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle on medium speed until just smooth, 15 to 20 seconds, do not overmix. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add sugar and beat on medium speed until just combined, about 20 seconds, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Whisk in canned pumpkin, remaining 2 eggs, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice until combined. It is okay if the batter is speckled with very small lumps of cream cheese.</li>
        <li>Slowly spoon pumpkin mixture over cake mixture and spread it into an even layer, leaving about a 1/2-inch border around the edges of the pan. Bake in the preheated oven until risen, and a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour, loosely tenting with foil after 50 minutes if needed to avoid over-browning. Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk together instant pudding and milk until thickened and smooth. Gently fold in whipped topping until no streaks remain.</li>
        <li>Spoon topping over cooled cake and spread into an even layer. Slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
